# Glen Rock Graduation Requirement

## Brief description of the program

## Motivation

I was having trouble finding courses to take for my senior year. I was struggling to find which credits I still needed to fulfill for the required categories to graduate. I wanted a way to track my remaining graduation requirements so that finding courses to take would be easier. My school does not have a graduation requirement checker, so I noticed many other students share the same problem as I do. I saw the need for a tool that can automatically check a student’s graduation requirement, and that was the start of this web app!

## UX Research Procedure

This is a screenshot of my application version 1.

Once the app opens, the user will be presented with a UI that shows textboxes with a “submit” button above as well as an “add class” button underneath. When the user clicks on a textbox they will be presented with a list of courses offered at Glen Rock High School. (The list was aggravated from Glen Rock High School official website). The user can either select a course from the list or type out the course, which will dynamically shorten the list of courses shown based on what is typed. Once they fill in all the necessary information, the “Submit” button will take them to a result page where it will show how many credits they have remaining for graduation for each category.

A survey took place to receive user’s feedback and comments, which will be used for improvements and design modification of the app. The survey contains different questions that ask the user how useful, accurate, and intuitive the app was. The link to the survey is provided below.
