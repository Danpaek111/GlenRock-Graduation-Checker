# Glen Rock Graudation Requirement

## Brief description of the program

## Motivation

I was having trouble finding courses to take for my senior year. I was struggling to find which credits I still needed to fulfill for the required categories to graduate. I wanted a way to track my remaining graduation requirements so that finding courses to take would be easier. My school does not have a graduation requirement checker, so I noticed many other students share the same problem as I do. I saw the need for a tool that can automatically check a studentâ€™s graduation requirement, and that was the start of this web app!
